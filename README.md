My portfolio

The Project is to create a responsive website using Bootstrap CSS as a framework.
Instructions: I was instructed to create three pages responsive website ('index.html', portfolio.html' and 'contact.html'. 

I used bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns) to have a functional and deployed application on mobile device and computer.

I also used bootstrap to create a sticky footer. 

I also linked my github account at the navbar logo (Kenneth Achumahara).
